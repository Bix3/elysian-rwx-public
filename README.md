# Elysian: RWX-Meme
Complete source code of the November, 2022 Elysian RWX-Meme.

## Why?
* We've released the source code for RWX in it's entirety due to the aftermath of a ex-developer going rouge.
* This version contains a lot more updated stuff than the "comprimised" source.
* This is completely **DETECTED**, you will not last very long using this. It makes for a great learning resource for people who want to learn about injection on games with EasyAntiCheat or Battleye.

This code is not licensed under any public use licenses or follow any guidelines. We'd recommend you'd use this strictly for studying but we know that some bad apples out there will try to create a product with this code. Hence, we've broken and changed some things in this code.
